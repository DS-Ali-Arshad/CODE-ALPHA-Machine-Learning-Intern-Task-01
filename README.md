# CODE-ALPHA-Machine-Learning-Intern-Task-01

Welcome to my CODE ALPHA Machine Learning Internship repository. This repository contains the code and analysis for my first task as a Machine Learning intern at CODE ALPHA. In this task, I've worked on a real-world dataset related to Breast Cancer and built machine learning models to predict whether a subject has cancer or not.

## Dataset
I used the Breast Cancer dataset, which contains information about subjects, including various features related to tumors and their diagnosis. The dataset is available in the 'Dataset' folder. 

## Data Preprocessing
I performed various data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and any other necessary data transformations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I explored the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable "diagnosis." Visualizations are available in the 'CODE_ALPHA_Task01_Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb' file.

## Machine Learning Models
I implemented machine learning models Random Forest and Support Vector Classification (SVC), to predict the presence of breast cancer. The 'CODE_ALPHA_Task01_Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb' file contains the code for each model.

## Results
The models achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting breast cancer. The ROC curves of the models performance is available in the 'Results' folder.

## Conclusion
In this task, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning for medical diagnosis. I successfully built and evaluated models for breast cancer prediction.
